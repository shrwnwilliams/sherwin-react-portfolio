    "story": "'Danger is my middle name; but I spell it Karen.' Jalana was my very first character, a Human Battle Master Fighter. One day, a new party member, Prospera, joined us as we were tasked with killing a Bheur Hag. The guild that we accepted the quest from asked us to keep Prospera safe, as this was her first quest. Throughout the fight with the hag, the party kept Prospera safe, right up until the end. The Bheur Hag cast Ice Storm and caught three of us in its radius, Prospera included. I dove onto her and protected her from the Ice Storm, dying in the process, but completely keeping her completely safe throughout the fight. After returning the town, the party scrambled to find someone to revive me. The first person they found had access to the Reincarnation spell, and Jalana was reincarnated as a Purple Dragonborn.",
